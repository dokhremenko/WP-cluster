### WordPress cluster KVM based

#####This is just exercises. Don't use at production(or at least configure Galera cluster:))

#######To Do:
- move user-data, meta-data to separate files from vm install script
- secure db password
- use Ansible modules instead deprecated commands(like decompress)
- manage known hosts check(wasn't work. remedy - ssh config)
